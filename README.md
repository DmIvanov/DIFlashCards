# DIFlashCards

Flash cards iOS-app where you can add new cards right from your mac. It's too exhausting to add cards one by one from your iPhone, much easier to use your mac with normal keyboard (and copy-past).

The main idea is that you have some .txt files with your cards which are chanhing all the time. So you can change them at your text editor, save them and deploy app to the device.
